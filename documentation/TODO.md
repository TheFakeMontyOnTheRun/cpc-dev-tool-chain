### Possible evolutions

These would be possible only with your help:

* integration with major IDEs (any IDE knowing about makefiles and gcc-style output already works)
* rules to automatically convert resources files into formats suitable for inclusions in projects (e.g. PNG image)
* run emulator automatically ?
* cleanly separate portable C and platform-compiler-output-specific parts, to ease not getting trapped in a particular toolset
* offer multi-platform build: run your portable C part as an actual native app (makes sense only if most app logic is in portable C)
