/** 177: MC BOOT PROGRAM
    #BD13
    Load and run a program.
    Action:
    Shut down as much of the system as possible then load a program into RAM and run
    it. If the load fails then the previous foreground program is restarted.
    Entry conditions:
    HL contains the address of the routine to call to load the program.
    Exit conditions:
    Does not exit!
    Notes:
    The system is partially reset before attempting to load the program. External
    interrupts are disabled, as are all timer, frame flyback and keyboard break events.
    Sound generation is turned off, indirections are set to their default routines and the
    stack is reset to the default system stack. This process ensures that no memory outside
    the firmware variables area is in use when loading the program. Overwriting an active
    event block or indirection routine could otherwise have unfortunate consequences.
    The partial system reset does not change the ROM state or ROM selection. The
    routine run to load the program must be in accessible RAM or an enabled ROM. Note
    that the firmware jumpblock normally enables the lower ROM and disables the upper
    ROM and so the routine must normally be in RAM above #4000 or in the lower ROM.
    The routine run to load the program is free to use any store from #0040 up to the base
    of the firmware variables area (#B100) and may alter indirections and arm external
    device interrupts as required. It should obey the following
    Exit conditions:
    If the program loaded successfully:
    Carry true.
    HL contains the program entry point.
    If the program failed to load:
    Carry false.
    HL corrupt.
    Always:
    A, BC, DE, IX, IY and other flags corrupt.

    After a successful load the firmware is completely initialized (as at EMS) and the
    program is entered at the entry address returned by the load routine. Returning from
    the program will reset the system (perform RST 0).
    After an unsuccessful load an appropriate error message is printed and the previous
    foreground program is restarted. If the previous foreground program was itself a RAM
    program then the default ROM is entered instead as the program may have been
    corrupted during the failed loading.

    178: MC START PROGRAM
    #BD16
    Run a foreground program.
    Action:
    Fully initialize the system and enter a program.
    Entry conditions:
    HL contains the entry point address.
    C contains the required ROM selection.
    Exit conditions:
    Never exits!
    Notes:
    HL and C comprise the 'far address' of the entry point of the foreground program (see
    section 2).
    When entering a foreground program in ROM the ROM selection should be that
    required to select the appropriate ROM. When entering a foreground program in RAM
    the ROM selection should be used to enable or disable ROMs as the RAM program
    requires (ROM select addresses #FC..#FF).
    This routine carries out a full EMS initialization of the firmware before entering the
    program. Returning from the program will reset the system (perform RST 0).
    MC START PROGRAM is intended for running programs in ROM or programs that
    have already been loaded into RAM. To load and run a RAM program use MC BOOT
    PROGRAM.

/** 179: MC WAIT FLYBACK
    #BD19
    Wait for frame flyback.
    Action:
    Wait until frame flyback occurs.
    Entry conditions:
    No conditions.
    Exit conditions:
    All registers and flags preserved.
    Notes:
    Frame flyback is a signal generated by the CRT controller to signal the start of the
    vertical retrace period. During this period the screen is not being written and so major
    operations can be performed on the screen without producing unsightly effects. A
    prime example is rolling the screen.
    The frame flyback signal only lasts for a couple of hundred microseconds but the
    vertical retrace period is much longer than this. However, there will be a ticker
    interrupt in the middle of frame flyback which may cause the foreground processing
    to be suspended for a significant length of time. It is important, therefore, to perform
    any critical processing as soon after the frame flyback is detected as is possible.
    This routine returns immediately if frame flyback is occurring when it is called. It
    does not wait for the start of frame flyback (use a frame flyback event to do this).

/** 180: MC SET MODE
    #BD1C
    Set the screen mode.
    Action:
    Load the hardware with the required screen mode.
    Entry conditions:
    A contains the required mode.
    Exit conditions:
    AF corrupt.
    All other registers preserved.
    Notes:
    The required mode is checked and no action is taken if it is invalid. If it is valid then
    the new value is sent to the hardware.
    The screen modes are:
    0:
    1:
    2:
    160 x 200 pixels,
    320 x 200 pixels,
    640 x 200 pixels,
    20 x 25 characters.
    40 x 25 characters.
    80 x 25 characters.
    Altering the screen mode without notifying the Screen Pack will produce peculiar
    effects on the screen. In general SCR SET MODE should be called to change screen
    mode. This, in turn, sets the new mode into the hardware.

/** WARNING DONE BUT UNTESTED, MIGHT NOT WORK

    181: MC SCREEN OFFSET
    #BD1F
    Set the screen offset.
    Action:
    Load the hardware with the offset of the first byte on the screen inside a 2K screen
    block and which 16K block the screen memory is located in.
    Entry conditions:
    A contains the new screen base.
    HL contains the new screen offset.
    Exit conditions:
    AF corrupt.
    All other registers preserved.
    Notes:
    The screen base address is masked with #C0 to make sure it refers to a valid 16K
    memory area. The default screen base is #C0 (the screen is underneath the upper
    ROM).
    The screen offset is masked with #07FE to make it legal. Note that bit 0 is ignored as
    the hardware only uses even offsets.
    If the screen base or offset is changed without notifying the Screen Pack then
    unexpected effects may occur on the screen. In general SCR SET BASE or SCR SET
    OFFSET should be called. These, in their turn, send the values to the hardware.
